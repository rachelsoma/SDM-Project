Part One
--------------------------------------------------------

Load and clean the data is the csv file


```{r}
#load the data from csv
foxData = read.csv("FlyingFoxMonitoring.csv",header = TRUE)


#converting factor to integer
blkFox <- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$BlackFlyingFox.Count))))
redFox<- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$LittleRedFlyingFox.Count))))
greyFox<- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$GreyHeadedFlyingFox.Count))))
totalFox <- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$TotalSpecies.Count))))

sum(is.na(blkFox))
sum(is.na(redFox))
sum(is.na(greyFox))

#removing data with NA
#find the rows which have missing data
idNAblk=which(is.na(blkFox))
idNAred=which(is.na(blkFox))
idNAgrey=which(is.na(blkFox))
idNAtotal=which(is.na(totalFox))

blkFox=blkFox[-idNAblk]
blkFox=blkFox[-idNAred]
blkFox=blkFox[-idNAgrey]
blkFox=blkFox[-idNAtotal]
redFox=redFox[-idNAblk]
redFox=redFox[-idNAred]
redFox=redFox[-idNAgrey]
redFox=redFox[-idNAtotal]
greyFox=greyFox[-idNAblk]
greyFox=greyFox[-idNAred]
greyFox=greyFox[-idNAgrey]
greyFox=greyFox[-idNAtotal]
totalFox=totalFox[-idNAblk]
totalFox=totalFox[-idNAred]
totalFox=totalFox[-idNAgrey]
totalFox=totalFox[-idNAtotal]

l=length(totalFox)

#calculate totals based on each species
myTotal = blkFox+redFox+greyFox
#myTotal

#
i=1
for (i in length(myTotal)){
  if (myTotal[i] != totalFox[i]){
    print(i)
  }
  else
  {
    
  }
  i=i+1
}

```
